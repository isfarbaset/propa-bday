    "text": "Special Memories with Propa Apu 💖\n\n\n\nJewelry Shopping Adventure\nA beautiful family outing\nThat wonderful day when we all went jewelry shopping together - you, me, Farhan, Uzayr, and Ammu! It was so special to have everyone together, picking out beautiful pieces and making memories. Your eye for detail and patience made it such a fun experience!\n\n\nGeeking Out Together\nOur shared obsessions!\nRemember all those times we geeked out about Harry Potter? And our coloring by numbers sessions? And binge-watching Wednesday together on Netflix? You make every nerdy moment so much fun! It’s so special to have someone who shares these passions.\n\n\nAlways There for Everyone\nYour selfless heart\nYou are always there for everyone, no matter what. Whether someone needs a listening ear, a helping hand, or just someone to lean on - you’re always ready to show up. Your caring nature is truly one of a kind, and we’re so grateful for you!\n\n\nYour Amazing Humor\nMaking everything lighter\nYou’re so funny! You have this incredible gift of making heavy situations lighter with your humor and warmth. Your laughter is contagious, and you know exactly how to brighten any moment. You bring so much joy to everyone around you!\n\n\nTaking Care of Me\nAt all the wedding events\nI’ll never forget how you made sure I was fed at all the wedding events! While everyone was busy and rushing around, you made it your mission to ensure I didn’t go hungry. That thoughtfulness and care meant the world to me!\n\n\nThe Room Decoration\nWhen I joined the family\nThe way you decorated Farhan’s room when I moved into the house after getting married - it was so beautiful and thoughtful! You made me feel so welcomed and at home from day one. That gesture showed just how caring and wonderful you are!\n\n\n\n  Back to Home"
